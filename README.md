# Springboard
Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning Engineering Track

This repository contains all of the mini-projects I completed during my time in the Springboard program. Furthermore, you will find three files related to my chosen capstone project. One is the script I used to augment and balance my dataset and the other two contain prototype models built using TensorFlow (Keras) and PyTorch(fastai). In order to maintain a lightweight model, I utilized the dephtwise seperable convolutions of MobileNet.
